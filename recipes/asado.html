    <h3>A typical asado in argentina</h3>
    <p>is the technique and the social event of 
        having or attending a barbecue in various 
        South American countries, especially 
        Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay 
        where it is also a traditional event. 
        An asado usually consists of beef, pork, 
        chicken, chorizo, and morcilla which 
        are cooked on a grill, called a parrilla, 
        or an open fire. Generally the meats are 
        accompanied by red wine and salads. This 
        meat is prepared by a person who is the 
        assigned asador or parrillero.

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <p>the ingredients can be vary due to 
        the number of optons.
    here are some suggestions:</p>
    <ul><h3>embutidos and achuras</h3>
        <li>chrizos</li>
        <li>chinchulines</li>
        <li>mollejas</li>
        <li>tripa gorda</li>
        <li>charcoal</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>salads</li>
        <li>dry wood</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start your fire. Make a stack 
            of dry wood sitting on top of 
            a heap of lump charcoal under the left-hand 
            side of your parrilla, a cast-iron grill which 
            can be adjusted to different heights</li>
        <li>Once the grill has heated up, give it 
            a vigorous clean with newspaper to 
            remove all yesterday’s carbonised 
            cow and arm yourself with the tools 
            of the asador the shovel and rake  
            for moving embers around.</li>
        <li>When the flames and smoke of 
            your initial fire have relented, 
            you will have a pile of smouldering 
            charcoal to the left of your grill, 
            from which you rake across glowing 
            embers to sit under the right.</li>
        <li>Lower the grill to 15cm above the 
            smouldering bed of coals. Waiting 
            in the wings are your cuts of meat, 
            very specific to the asado, so introduce 
            the biggest cuts first, starting with 
            the tira de asado </li>
            <li> Keep the hottest coals aside 
            to avoid fat dripping and flares 
            of smoke, which spoil the flavour 
            of the meat. Vacio (flank) and entraña 
            (skirt) are two other flavoursome cuts, 
            which respond beautifully to asado cooking.</li>
        <li>It’s impossible to overcook beef 
            in Argentina, as the locals like it 
            medium to well done. If the meat is 
            good, they say, this is the best way to
            cook it: low and slow.</li>
    </ol>
