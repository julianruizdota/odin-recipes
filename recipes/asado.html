    <h2>A typical asado in argentina</h2>
    <p>is the technique and the social event of 
        having or attending a barbecue[1] in various 
        South American countries, especially 
        Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay 
        where it is also a traditional event. 
        An asado usually consists of beef, pork, 
        chicken, chorizo, and morcilla which 
        are cooked on a grill, called a parrilla, 
        or an open fire. Generally the meats are 
        accompanied by red wine and salads. This 
        meat is prepared by a person who is the 
        assigned asador or parrillero.
